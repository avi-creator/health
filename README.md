# AI-Powered Personal Health Analyzer

An intelligent health monitoring system that uses machine learning and computer vision to analyze facial expressions, voice patterns, and lifestyle data to provide insights into mental and physical well-being.

## Features

- **Facial Expression Analysis**: Detects and analyzes facial expressions to identify stress levels and emotional states
- **Voice Analysis**: Analyzes voice tone and patterns to detect stress and emotional changes
- **Lifestyle Data Integration**: Processes daily activity and sleep patterns
- **Health Insights**: Provides personalized health recommendations based on analyzed data
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Offers continuous health status updates
- **Privacy-Focused**: All data processing is done locally, ensuring user privacy

## Technical Stack

- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow for deep learning models
- OpenCV for computer vision
- MediaPipe for facial landmark detection
- Librosa for audio processing
- Flask for web interface
- Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms
